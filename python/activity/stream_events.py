Activity Stream - X API v2
==========================
Endpoint: GET https://api.x.com/2/activity/stream
Docs: https://docs.x.com/x-api/activity/introduction

Opens a persistent HTTP connection and streams real-time activity events
matching your active subscriptions. Events are delivered as they occur on
the platform — no polling required.

You must create at least one subscription (see create_subscription.py) before
events will be delivered to this stream.

Authentication: Bearer Token (App-only)
Required env vars: BEARER_TOKEN
